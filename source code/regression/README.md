For disease and gene

1.First,run disease-gene-reg1.py,disease-gene-reg2.py,disease-gene-reg3.py in turn, then you get the relationship between diseases and genes.

2.Second,run disease-gene-softmax.py file, then you get the softmax relationship between diseases and genes.


For gene and miRNA

1.First,run gene-mir-reg1.py,gene-mir-reg2.py,gene-mir-reg3.py in turn, then you get the relationship between genes and miRNAs.

2.Second,run gene-mir-softmax.py file, then you get the softmax relationship between genes and miRNAs.
